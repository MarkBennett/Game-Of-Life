Iteration 1 (12:30 - 1:30)
-----------

I didn't make it very far in this phase only having time to setup jessie to run tests and CoffeeScript with Cake to monitor my files. The only code I wrote was a World class with an iterate method that didn't do anything.

What worked... Jessie and CoffeScript provide a smooth workflow for BDD
What didn't... I didn't make it as far as having anything in the browser, or having a world with anything in it
What I'll do differently... know how to use Jessie, don't setup the Cakefile
